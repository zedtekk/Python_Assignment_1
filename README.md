Create a FastAPI project with the following specifications:
A Student resource. Each student will have:
Id (int)
Name(str)

For data storage, use an in-memory storage (Python dictionary)
Create endpoints to do the following:

Retrieve a Student resource (one Student and many Students)
Update a Student resource
Delete a Student resource
Push your project to a public git repository and post you submission here
Goodluck!
